## About Tic-Tac-Toe

Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple and classic two-player game, usually played on a 3x3 grid. One player uses the symbol "X" and the other uses "O". Players take turns placing their symbol in an empty square on the grid.

To play, players decide who goes first, then alternate turns placing their symbol in one of the nine squares. The goal is to be the first to create a line of three of your symbols either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If all squares are filled and no player has three in a row, the game ends in a draw.

To win, a player must carefully observe the board, plan ahead, and try to block the opponent's moves while creating their own line of three. Strategic thinking and anticipating the opponentâ€™s next step are key to winning in Tic-Tac-Toe.
